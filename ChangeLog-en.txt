0.3.2 Fri Apr 26 23:09:17 MSK 2019

    Implemented HDMI re-enabling after HDCP turns off. Usually happens
    after TV refresh rate switch and can lead to "black screen".

    Enhanced framerate detection via vdec_chunks; earlier fps computations
    could be influenced by a serious precision error. This should reduce
    the number of failed fps detections.

    Added limited support for Minux Neo U9-H. The Minix kernel has broken
    most of the information sources used by AFRd to determine movie framerate,
    except one, but that source is not very stable. So, on these firmwares
    (even ported to other devices) AFRd will work much worse than on
    "normal chinese" firmware.

0.3.1 Fri Apr 12 09:31:15 MSK 2019

    Changed copying conditions (license) from 'none' to GPL-3.
    Added full license text to application (on the 'About' page).

    Added the switch.hdmi option that allows to adjust the handling
    of HDMI hotplug events, or disable it altogether.

    Fixed a bug that would cause application notification sometimes
    to display the wrong current refresh rate 

    Added display of current value in preferences editor.

    Now supporting switching colorspaces on kernel 3.14.29
    (Android 6 & 7)!

    Fixed black screen on refresh rate change on boxes with built-in
    HDCP 1.4 keys. This also was the cause of "black screen" at system
    startup for many users.

    Fixed framerate not switching in some circumstances (for example,
    HDVideBox + MX Player) because of the added in previous version
    option switch.ignore.

0.3.0 Sun Apr 7 12:54:16 MSK 2019

    Now daemon checks if another daemon is already running and won't
    run a second copy.

    Fixed some bugs that could lead to afrd crashes.

    Installation and set-up via Android application!

    Notifications fixed in Android 6 & 7

    New option to show display refresh rate after changes.

    Added the obligatory 'About' screen.

    Added the 'Frequently Asked Questions' screen.

    Removed dependency of Android setting key_hdmi_selfadaptation,
    now there are many other ways to disable afrd.

    Substantially improved frame rate detection algorithm.

    Added option frhint.vdec.blacklist so that afrd will ignore
    FRAME_RATE_HINTs from certain video decoders. This allowed
    to solve an old problem on Android 6 and 7 with the H265
    decoder, which generates wrong frame rates.

    Added user-mode API so that co-operative video player software
    can tell afrd the expected framerate of the starting video,
    and more (see docs).

    When started as daemon, afrd will now switch to root namespace
    to avoid problems with the 'use separate namespaces' option of SuperSU.

    Added switch.ignore config option and the equivalent setting in
    Android application to ignore video rewinds.

0.2.4 Sun Mar 10 18:22:32 2019 +0300

    Added option switch.timeout that sets the timeout for framerate switch.
    If movie frame rate can't be determined for so much time, framerate
    switching fails.

    Added option switch.blackout to blackout the screen at start of playback.
    This removes unneeded flicker at playback start time.

    AFRd installer via System Recovery!

0.2.2 Fri Mar 8 00:34:39 2019 +0300

    Substantially enhanced frame rate detection of the starting movie.
      * After start afrd will wait 300ms.
      * After that every 100ms afrd guesses fps by querying video decoder
        status, if it is present.
      * Also video decoder statistics (chunk pps times) are queried and
        another guess is made off that.
      * If three times in a row these values are less than 0.1% apart,
        afrd considers the guess correct.

    (Re-)implemented support for Android kernels < 7.0

    Now it is possible to choose either only fractional frame rates
    (23.976, 29.97, 59.94), only integer (24, 30, 60) or all.

    Now it is possible to choose whenever afrd will prefer larger refresh
    rates (e.g. 50hz for 25fps, 60hz for 30fps) or use exactly same rate.

    HDMI hot-plugging events now supported; TV autodetection will be re-run.

    Now you can blacklist some of the refresh rates.

    Now you can change color space, color depth and color range for every
    supported video mode. This effectively makes AFR possible in 4k!

    Setting switch.delay.off to 0 will disable restoration of the original
    refresh rate at all.

    Added option switch.delay.retry to set the delay before repeated tries
    to detect frame rate, if previous attempt fails.

0.2.0 Sat Feb 23 02:20:21 2019 +0300

    Implemented refresh rate switching by hardware decoder activation.
    This allows afrd to work without kernel support and makes it a universal
    tool for most newer AmLogic based devices.

    Switching by FRAME_RATE_HINT events is still there and has higher priority.

    Tried to get rid of extraneous rate switches during ff/rewind.

0.1.1 Tue Jan 1 17:48:50 2019 +0300

    Added X96 support via patched kernel 4.9 for S905X2.

    Added fractional fps support (23.976, 29.97, 59.94).

0.1.0 Sun Aug 20 21:59:45 2017 +0300

    First release of the auto framerate daemon as part of the custom kernel
    for Android TV box X92/S912.
